0.033 2017-04-22 IKRUGLOV
    - yahc_conn_socket_cache_id(): return undef if conn is undef
    - when considering droping a socket take into account response protocol
    - socket_cache as callback
    - fix bug in yahc_terminal_error()
    - don't set backoff time when backoff callback returned 0
    - support of HEAD method
    - can pass headers in ->new()
    - do not overwrite Host header when set by user
    - implement yahc_conn_user_data()
    - improved tests

0.032 2017-02-27 IKRUGLOV
    - socket cache support multiple file handles per destination
    - uniq connections ids

0.031 2017-01-17 IKRUGLOV
    - clarification of docs
    - yahc_retry_conn() can accept backoff_delay arg
    - fix double setting args in ->new() and ->request()
    - optimize internal timer creation

0.030 2016-10-13 IKRUGLOV
    - report sent body (cut to 1024 bytes) in timeline
    - more fare scheduling of retries
    - enrich error messages with numeric representation of $! or IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_ERROR
    - stop leaking connections once completed
    - drop() can force socket to be closed
    - new tests

0.029 2016-09-06 IKRUGLOV
    - fix problem with empty head param when building http request body
    - improved docs
    - lots of improvments in tests

0.028 2016-07-23 IKRUGLOV
    - new yahc_conn_register_error()
    - new yahc_conn_attempt()
    - *change in behaivor* - timeout errors are marked with new
      YAHC::Error::TIMEOUT() bit. So, direct comparation like $err ==
      YAHC::Error::CONNECT_TIMEOUT() won't work anymore and should be done as
      bitmask check $err & YAHC::Error::CONNECT_TIMEOUT.
    - bugfix in backoff_delay logic
    - bugfix in user_callback calls, update EV internal time to avoid deviation.
    - added t/account_for_signal.t into MANIFEST
    - beter docs
    - more tests

0.027 2016-07-16 IKRUGLOV
    - new backoff_delay feature
    - new lifetime_timeout feature
    - *change in behaivor* - in case of internal error, exception in
      callback or expiration of lifetime_timeout callback is called with
      TERMINAL_ERROR bit set in $error. In this case all further attempt to
      retry or reinit connection are ignored and the connection goes to
      COMPLETED state unconditionally. Previous behaivor was that a connection
      silently terminates.
    - *change in behaivor* - give all timeouts the highest priorities in event
      loop. This provides stonger timeout guarantee but can cause timeouts in
      border cases which didn't happen before.
    - *change in behaivor* - when connection failed all retry attempts report
      error condition with new error YAHC::Error::RETRY_LIMIT instead of
      YAHC::Error::CONNECT_ERROR
    - rename YAHC::State::WAIT_SYNACK to YAHC::State::CONNECTING
    - improved tests
    - improved docs
